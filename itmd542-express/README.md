## Insights and Results
Throughout the development of this project, I faced challenges in setting up the API, primarily due to inconsistencies in naming conventions. Additionally, I encountered difficulties in presenting the date in a readable format. However, I seized this opportunity to broaden my skills. I learned to work with Express.js for API development, design using a PUG template, and leverage the Tailwind CSS library. Through dedication and learning, I successfully navigated these challenges and achieved my goals.
